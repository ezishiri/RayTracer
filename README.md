# RayTracer
In an effort to understand computer graphics, here is an (minimal) in progress implementation of the ray tracing algorithm as described by ssloy. In future iterations I can add reflection, refraction, importing scenes, other file formats, shadows etc in my implementation, but for now you can render plastic looking  spheres in 3d!
